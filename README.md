# BasicMotor

BasicMotor is a Java library designed to simplify motor control logic for FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) robots. It provides a unified API for interacting with different types of motors, making robot code cleaner and easier to maintain.

## Features

- Unified motor interface for FRC robots
- Built-in support for simulation environments
- Integrated PID control for precise motor control
- Automatic logging of motor data using AdvantageKit for easy telemetry and debugging
- Multithreaded architecture for high-speed, responsive motor updates
